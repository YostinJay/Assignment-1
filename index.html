        To be plausible, the descriptive writer has to constrain the concrete, evocative image to suit the reader's
        knowledge and attention span. "Her eyes were brighter than the sapphires in the armrests of the Tipu Sultan's
        golden throne, yet sharper than the tulwars of his cruelest executioners" will have the reader checking their
        phone halfway through. "Her eyes were sapphires, bright and hard" creates the same effect in a fraction of the
        reading time. As always in the craft of writing: when in doubt, write less.

      <h3>Cloning species</h3>

      <p>
        Horticulture cloning refers to generating descendants of a single
        plant by vegetative production. Many horticulture plant cultivars are
        clones, that have been derived from a single individual, and then
        multiplied by a process other than sexual reproduction. For
        example,some strains of European grapes are clones that have been
        propagated for over two millena. Other examples of clones are the
        potato and banana plants.
      </p>

      <p>
        Grafting is a technique that is similar to cloning, because the shoots
        and branches from the graft result in the creation of a genetic clone
        of a single individual plant. However, this type of cloning is
        typically classified as an entirely different kind of operation.
