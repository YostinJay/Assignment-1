        <img src="images/haystacks.png" alt="Exotic Tree" /><strong>Impressionism</strong> is a 19th-century <em>art movement </em>that originated with a group of Paris-based artists. Their independent exhibitions brought them to prominence during the 1870s and 1880s, in spite of harsh opposition from the conventional art community in France. The name of the style derives from the title of a <em>Claude Monet</em> work, Impression, soleil levant (Impression, Sunrise), which provoked the critic Louis Leroy to coin the term in a satirical review published in the Parisian newspaper Le Charivari.

      <p>
        Impressionist painting characteristics include relatively samll, thin, yet visible brush strokes, open composition, emphasis on accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities (often accentuating the effects of the passage of time), ordinary subject matter, inclusion of movement as a crucial element of human perception and experience, and unusual visual angles.
      </p>

      <p> The development of Impressionism in the visual arts was soon followed bt analogous styles in other media that became known as impressionist music and impressionist literature.</p>

        French painters who prepared the way for Impressionism inculde the Romantic colourist Eugène Delacroix, the leader of the realists Gustave Courbet, and painters of the Barbizon school such as Théodore Rousseau. The Impressionists learned much from the work of Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot and Eugène Boudin, who painted from nature in a style that was similar to Impressionism, and who befriended and advised the younger artists.
      </p>

      <p>
        A number of identifiable techniques and working habits contributed to the innovative style of the Impressionists. Although these methods had been used by previous artists--and are often conspicuous in the work of artist such as Frans Hais, Diego Velázquez, Peter Paul Rubens, John Constable, and J.M.W Turner--the Impressionists were the first to use them all together, and with such consitency.
