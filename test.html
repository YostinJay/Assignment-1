          To be plausible, the descriptive writer has to constrain the concrete, evocative image to suit the reader's
          knowledge and attention span. "Her eyes were brighter than the sapphires in the armrests of the Tipu Sultan's
          golden throne, yet sharper than the tulwars of his cruelest executioners" will have the reader checking their
          phone halfway through. "Her eyes were sapphires, bright and hard" creates the same effect in a fraction of the
          reading time. As always in the craft of writing: when in doubt, write less.

          <p> The Starry Night is an oil on canvas painting by Dutch Post-Impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh.
            Painted
            in June 1889, it depicts the view from the east-facing window of his asylum room at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence,
            just before sunrise, with the addition of an imaginary village.[1][2][3] It has been in the permanent
            collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City since 1941, acquired through the Lillie P. Bliss
            Bequest. Regarded as among Van Gogh's finest works,[4] The Starry Night is one of the most recognized
            paintings in the history of Western culture.[5][6]</p>

          <p>Impressionism is a 19th-century art movement characterized by relatively small, thin, yet visible brush
            strokes, open composition, emphasis on accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities (often
            accentuating the effects of the passage of time), ordinary subject matter, inclusion of movement as a
            crucial
            element of human perception and experience, and unusual visual angles. Impressionism originated with a group
            of Paris-based artists whose independent exhibitions brought them to prominence during the 1870s and 1880s.

            Instead of painting in a studio, the impressionists found that they could capture the momentary and
            transient
            effects of sunlight by working quickly, in front of their subjects, in the open air (en plein air) rather
            than
            in a studio. This resulted in a greater awareness of light and colour and the shifting pattern of the
            natural
            scene. Brushwork became rapid and broken into separate dabs in order to render the fleeting quality of
            light.

            The first group exhibition was in Paris in 1874 and included work by Monet, Auguste Renoir, Edgar Degas and
            Paul Cezanne. The work shown was greeted with derision with Monet’s Impression, Sunrise particularly singled
            out for ridicule and giving its name (used by critics as an insult) to the movement. Seven further
            exhibitions
            were then held at intervals until 1886.
