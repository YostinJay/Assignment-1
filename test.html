        To be plausible, the descriptive writer has to constrain the concrete, evocative image to suit the reader's
        knowledge and attention span. "Her eyes were brighter than the sapphires in the armrests of the Tipu Sultan's
        golden throne, yet sharper than the tulwars of his cruelest executioners" will have the reader checking their
        phone halfway through. "Her eyes were sapphires, bright and hard" creates the same effect in a fraction of the
        reading time. As always in the craft of writing: when in doubt, write less.

        <p> The Starry Night is an oil on canvas painting by Dutch Post-Impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh. Painted
          in June 1889, it depicts the view from the east-facing window of his asylum room at Saint-RÃ©my-de-Provence,
          just before sunrise, with the addition of an imaginary village.[1][2][3] It has been in the permanent
          collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City since 1941, acquired through the Lillie P. Bliss
          Bequest. Regarded as among Van Gogh's finest works,[4] The Starry Night is one of the most recognized
          paintings in the history of Western culture.[5][6]</p>

        <p>Impressionism is a 19th-century art movement characterized by relatively small, thin, yet visible brush
          strokes, open composition, emphasis on accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities (often
          accentuating the effects of the passage of time), ordinary subject matter, inclusion of movement as a crucial
          element of human perception and experience, and unusual visual angles. Impressionism originated with a group
          of Paris-based artists whose independent exhibitions brought them to prominence during the 1870s and 1880s.
